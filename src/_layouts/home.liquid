In persuing my passion of photography, one of the greatest joys I get is taking photos of these little precious bundles of love. Having a baby is a wonderful blessing, but believe me they grow up too fast! Which is why having a family heirloom to treasure forever will bring smiles and laughter for years to come. Feel free to have a look at my galleries in hope of some inspiration for your little bundle's first photoshoot!</p>

      I always had a love for Photography. When I started my education in communications, with a major in advertising, I took photography as a regular class and I got my first professional camera. Photography became my biggest passion. I took every class available. Pretty soon I became the official photographer in my hometown Tamarindo. I started with graduations and festivals, then Quincea√±eras and Weddings.
    </p>

    <p>My passion for photography and my desire to go to the Brooks Institute of Photography in Santa Barbara, brought me to the Central Coast where I found the love of my life: Mr. Paul Byrum. We now have been married over 20 years and have 3 wonderful children; Brianna, Paul and Marc.</p>

    <p>Enjoying my kids growing up, and busy with sports, I slowed down with weddings. My wedding couples began bringing me their babies to photograph and it reignited a new passion for photography in me. There is something about newborns that gives me so much joy! For the past few years I have been perfecting my craft, and finding and developing a style that works for me. I am ready to confidently shift my focus and creative energy towards newborn photography, and launch my new site: 805 Babies.</p>
