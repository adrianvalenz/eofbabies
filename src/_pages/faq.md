## Newborn Questions

### Do you have clothing and props for newborns?

Yes we have tons! You really do not need to bring anything. For special requests, please let us know ahead of time.

### My baby has acne, do you retouch?

Yes basic skin retouching is included. For extra retouching (color changes, head swaps, tattoo removable) extra charges may apply.

### I have pre-booked my newborn, now what? What if my baby comes early or late?

We ask that all clients e-mail or call within 24-48 hours of having your baby. Most babies are booked anywhere from 5-10 or even 12 or 14 days depending on the baby's weight. Letting us know when you have your baby early enough allows room for rescheduling and adjusting.

### I missed the newborn window and my baby is now 2 months old, do you take them?

We photography babies of any age. Your baby is no longer a newborn however you can still book a session. Please understand the baby most likely will not be able to do newborn poses or wraps and they are usually awake and do not cooperate as well.

## Maternity questions

### When is the best time to take belly pictures?

For belly love images it's best to schedule your session around week 32-34. If this is not your first pregnancy you can also schedule it earlier but I do not recommend before week 28 as your belly will still growa lot in the last few weeks.

### Can I include my family in the session?

Yes, you can include your partner and/or your children at the session. Please notify me in advance if you want to include your family that I can prepare accordingly.

### When should I book my belly session?

Due to my full schedule it's best to book your belly session a few weeks in advance. If you plan to book a package also including a Newborn session include the planned birthday of your child in the request.

### Can I bring my own props?

Yes, you can bring your own props if the session will take place outside. Due to the current situation I can at the moment not accept any props in the home studio.

### What should I wear?

I have a beautiful selection of maternity dresses available which are onesize who fit most women. It is possible to bring along your own clothes.

## Cake Smash Questions

### When should we take Cake Smash pictures?

Usually Cake Smash sessions are taking place around baby's first birthday, but I'm flexible about that. It is helpful that a child is able to sit alone and is able to crawl.

### Can I include my family in the session?

Yes, you can include other family members to the session. Please notify me in advance who you want to include so I can prepare accordingly.

### When should I book a Cake Smash?

Due to my full schedule it's best to book the Cake Smash session a few weeks in advance.

### Can I bring my own props?

Yes, you can bring your own props if the session will take place outside. Due to the current situation I cannot accept any external props in the home studio.

### What should my child wear?

I have a beautiful selection of dresses available, but also love to shop for a specific theme. If you opt for a special theme it is possible to bring along your own clothes.

### What flavor will the cake have?

Please let me know at the time of booking what flavor the cake should have. If your child has allergies I advise to organise the cake yourself.
