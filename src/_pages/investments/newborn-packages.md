  You're ready to invest in a beautiful heart-melting set of photos of your newborn, but what's the best option for you? If this is your first child, The Newborn Mini session is a great choice. If the baby is going to have brothers and/or sisters ready to greet the little one then the Mini Plus or Full session can give them the opportunity to take some wonderful photos together.
